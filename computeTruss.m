% computeTruss(ts)
% This fills in the matrix Ax=B for the truss and solves it using x=A\B
%========
% Inputs:
% ts is a structure that contains the following fields:
%   * ts.trussMembers is a [nx4] matrix where n is the number of members. 
%       each row contains the x, y start and x, y stop coordnate of each 
%       member. 
%   * ts.trussSupports is a [1x4] matrix containing the x, y coordinates 
%       of the pin and roller, respectively
%   * ts.trussLoads is a [nx4] matrix where n is the number of loading points.
%       each row contains x and y coordinates of the loading points, 
%       as well as the x and y magnitude of the loading
%   * ts.trussForces contains x matrix of unknowns in Ax=B equation
%       its size shoud be [(N+3)x1], where N is the number of members. 
%=========
% Outputs:
% Updates ts with trussForces updated

function [] = computeTruss(ts)
% compute the length of each member and store this in memberLengths
for i=1:size(ts.trussMembers,1)
    memberLengths(i)=sqrt((ts.trussMembers(i,1)-ts.trussMembers(i,3))^2+...
        (ts.trussMembers(i,2)-ts.trussMembers(i,4))^2);
end

% Compute coordinate of each unique joint.
trussJoints = unique([ts.trussMembers(:,1:2);ts.trussMembers(:,3:4)],'rows');
% create empty A and B matrix. A should be [2J x 2J]m, B should be[2J x 1]
A = zeros(size(trussJoints,1)*2,size(trussJoints,1)*2);
B = zeros(size(trussJoints,1)*2,1);
